## FLUIDBOI.
FLUIDBOI. is a framework that has the absolute basics for a platformer. It uses the engine, ANTIRUINS (by lerabot) which is for the Dreamcast. <br />

The current demo includes:

# Getting Started
Before you start, you'll need:
- ANTIRUINS by lerabot (this is what the framework uses)
- VS CODE (haven't tested other IDEs)
- Dreamcast (or an emulator)


Navigate your way to the ANTIRUINS folder and paste the framework inside.
You can do this by:
- Downloading the folder
- Unzip it
- Copy the folder into the ANTIRUINS folder


OR you can do it by code: <br />
`cd antiruins` <br />
`git clone https://github.com/dylndreams/FLUIDBOI..git` <br />
