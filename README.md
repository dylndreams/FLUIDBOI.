# PROJ:VIGILANTE.
This is just me uploading the framework For 3D, it uses the engine, ANTIRUINS (by lerabot) which is for the Dreamcast. <br />
But it might take a while since ANTIRUINS doesn't intend 3D <br />

The demo will plan to have:
- [ ] Movement
- [ ] Gravity
- [ ] Collision
- [ ] Smart Auto Camera
- [ ] Momentum
- [ ] Possible ARG 

# Getting Started
Before you start, you'll need:
- ANTIRUINS by lerabot 
- VS CODE (haven't tested other IDEs)
- Dreamcast (or an emulator)
- a couple libraries (zed.lua, bump-3dpd.lua, etc.)

## Installing
Navigate your way to the ANTIRUINS gitlab to learn how to add the <br/> 
framework as a project and how to install.
