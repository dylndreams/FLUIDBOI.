# FLUIDBOI.
FLUIDBOI. is a framework that has the absolute basics for a platformer. For 2D, it uses the engine, ANTIRUINS (by lerabot) which is for the Dreamcast. <br />
For 3D, you might have to wait a little <br />

The current demo includes:
- [x] Movement
- [ ] Gravity
- [ ] Simple Collision Detection
- [ ] Momentum 

# Getting Started
Before you start, you'll need:
- ANTIRUINS by lerabot (this is what the framework uses)
- VS CODE (haven't tested other IDEs)
- Dreamcast (or an emulator)

## Installing
Navigate your way to the ANTIRUINS folder and paste the framework inside.
You can do this by:
- Downloading the folder
- Unzip it
- Copy the folder into the ANTIRUINS folder

OR you can do it by code: <br />
